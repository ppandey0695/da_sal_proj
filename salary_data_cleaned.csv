About Us: At Emendata, we help bridge the gap between data and the real world. We partner with organizations that have a social mission and help them tackle their problems using analytics. Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable. Importantly, we understand that this analytics pipeline does not live in a vacuum. Getting to meaningful numbers requires more than just the right methods; it calls for understanding the people, policies, data, and systems involved. With this approach, our small but fast-growing team is having a big impact, taking on challenges like using analytics to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare.
About the Role: This role leads the way in producing analytics that reflect a deep level of understanding and a high degree of quality. We are looking for you to:
Take analyses from end to end: Understand the client’s problem, identify the right research question, plan the methodology, corral the data, code the analysis, interpret the results, craft the deliverable, and communicate the story
Apply a research mentality: Use all tools at our disposal (documentation, policy regulations, data investigations, etc.) to make sound analytic decisions
Help the team deliver its best work: Turn direction from clients/senior staff into tactical plans and work closely with data analysts to help them implement (conducting code reviews, teaching/reinforcing analytic strategies, etc.)
This role will be a good fit for people who naturally push towards progress and are undeterred when that requires a lot of effort or stepping into unfamiliar territory. Emendata is growing rapidly, and we are looking for people who are excited to march forward together.

Sundae's mission is to help homeowners get the best outcome when it's time to sell a house that needs some love.

With scale and efficiency, we're able to deliver the most competitive price to sellers so that Sundae can become the largest buyer of homes that need love in the United States.

Data Analyst,"�� What we’re building

After creating custom payment systems in-house at previous companies and realizing the pain of keeping these ad-hoc solutions up to date, we started asking how other businesses were handling their business-to-business payment needs.

Ideally someone that can also help with solution engineering would be great to have.

Behavioral Skills/Competencies:
Title and Definition

Dependability

Makes and fulfills commitments. Has established a pattern of working independently, meeting reasonable deadlines, and accepting

responsibility for his or her actions. Willingly makes promises and fully intends to keep them. Arrives at work on time and ready to

contribute. Shows up for meetings well-prepared. This contrasts with individuals who have proven to be unreliable when others have

counted on them to show up on time, meet deadlines and expectations, or arrive prepared and ready to contribute.

Organizational Awareness

Understands the internal climate of the organization, including the most productive channels of communication, and makes use of the

appropriate communication channels to achieve goals and objectives. Has learned about both formal and informal communication

channels and understands when to stick to the formal hierarchy of reporting relationships. Understands unwritten protocols and the

political aspects of how communication takes place. Avoids errors in judgment when selecting strategies for accomplishing tasks.

This is distinctly different than those who fail to understand formal and informal channels of communication, misread organizational

dynamics and are left scratching their heads about why their efforts to achieve support and results fall short of their expectations.

Education and Self Development

Makes it a practice to take charge of self-development by soliciting feedback, setting priorities, and then acquiring or strengthening

skills and knowledge through coursework or other methods. This is in distinct contrast to those who avoid, discount or ignore

feedback, fail to identify self-improvement needs or resist learning opportunities as unnecessary or untimely.

Customer Focus

Personally demonstrates that external (or internal) customers are a high priority. Identifies customer needs and expectations and

responds to them in a timely and effective manner. Anticipates and prevents delays or other things that can adversely affect the

customer. Keeps customers informed about the status of pending actions and inquires about customer satisfaction with products or

services. Works to develop relationships of trust and confidence with customers; Considers the customer's perspective and seeks to

gain a broader understanding of the customer's needs and issues, even beyond those expressed. Anticipates customer needsa nd

works to prevent problems from arising. Seeks out customer feedback and acts on it in order to improve the level of service. This is in

sharp contrast to behavior patterns that tend to disappoint customers, leave them feeling forgotten and unimportant or that otherwise

result in unmet needs or expectations.

Innovative Thinking

Looks out for new and innovative approaches that will improve efficiency. Embraces and champions new ideas and encourages

others to do likewise. Recognizes and rewards people and teams who are creative and innovative. This is in sharp contrast to those

who tend to embrace the status quo, struggle with new approaches and discourage others when they are creative and innovative in

the pursuit of increased efficiency or effectiveness.

Serving as Advisor

When needed, serves as an advisor regarding technical aspects of a project. Makes recommendations related to procedures and

resources that may be needed. Has gained the respect and confidence of the people he/she advises. This is distinctly different from

those whose advice fails to result in improving efficiency or avoiding pitfalls on projects and/or whose track record or ability to

persuade others creates a lack of credibility and a lack of confidence in following any advice offered.

Solving Problems

Takes a proactive approach to anticipating and preventing problems. When problems occur, defines those problems, investigates

obstacles, gathers relevant information, decides whether solving the problem should be a group decision, generates and analyzes

alternate solutions and arrives at a workable solution. This differs from those who are not proactive, typically get surprised when

problems occur, attempt to solve problems without the right mix of people involved, push too quickly for solutions or generate

solutions that are not viable.

The Research Data Analyst will participate in studies of brain MRI data and the genetic basis of brain structure and function. The degree of independence and leadership over projects will depend on the individual's past experience.

We are looking for people that believe data is the new gold.

We are looking for data analysts, data engineers, data scientists with excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities. We have projects lining up developing research-grade science data algorithms from in-situ sensors to bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies into enterprise platforms to make available on open-data platforms. Our projects vary: creating data and bigdata prototypes whether it be on CartoDB geospatial, D3 Sankeys and various libraries, feeding and harvesting RDF Triplets into catalogs, or integrating into SEO environments. Admittedly, we have some less sexy data wrangling and janitor tasks that will require more ETL skills to hone in on.

To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.

Our analysts will be on teams that, through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture. Analysts will also be working very closely with client staff or system integrators to rapidly implement changes or agile release. Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.

Position Requirements:
You will be expected to rapidly ramp-up on client lingo, proactively make observations of patterns, anomalies, problems, and be customer service focused. You will be expected to be highly self-motivated and understand you will be held accountable to commitments. We look for decisive individuals able to rapidly respond to change requests and able to communicate, track, and escalate risk. We expect you to be proactive, efficient, and ready to learn quickly in response to all client and team member needs. This is a bootcamp-type position setup for growth.

We want you to not only gain technical skills, but also grow your interactive and client facing skills. All roles will require strong communication and interactive skills - oral, written, visual especially for triaging conflict, ideation barriers, mitigating risk, foster thought diversity and team environment. We expect all our roles to have a mastery of their technical level at their role whether that be in architectural methods, languages, work products, consulting techniques, and client culture. If they are not, they need to demonstrate how they are VERY fast learners.

Career Path Tech - Depending on the role: data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, here are some example tech stacks depending on the project).
